# Banking_Case_Study
Banking Case Study: Predictive modeling using XGBoost and Logistic Regression. Achieved over 80% accuracy on customer data and analyzed feature correlations using heatmaps.

Project Overview

This project is a small-scale predictive modeling case study on banking customer data. The goal is to predict key customer behaviors using machine learning models, primarily XGBoost and Logistic Regression. The model achieved over 80% accuracy, demonstrating effective predictive capability with the given features.

Key Features

Applied XGBoost and Logistic Regression models for prediction.

Performed feature analysis using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) to check multicollinearity.

Visualized feature correlations using heatmaps via Seaborn.

Selected features include:

Business_Revenue, CMV, ExternalBalance, FICO, Income, Last_6M_Avg_Remit, preavgremit1_3_all, preferred_bal_line, Supplementary_Cards, isChargeCust
